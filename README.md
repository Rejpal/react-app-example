# Example React App for rendering dynamic data structure

## Description
Small react app to show what I am capable of.

## Ordered Todo list
1) create visualization of kids
2) collapsing kid tables
3) add standardjs
4) make jest and enzyme running
5) add posibility to delete row
6) add posibility to edit cells
7) create store

### Struggles notices
- Understanding the data structure and what exactly should I make took me few days. First to data models went out of the window because the would not match the dinamic possibilies of given data.
- Using MST will be problematic because of dynamic data. Should still be possible, but will be challenging as I have never used it on dinamic data before.
- Typescript makes development slower but the code is more reliable. Transfer from flow is smooth so far.
