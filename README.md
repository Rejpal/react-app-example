# Example React App for rendering dynamic data structure

## Description
Small react app to show what I am capable of.

## how to run the project
1) clone the repository
2) open clonned repository folder in command line
2) run `yarn install` or `npm install` to install dependencies
3) run `yarn start` or `npm start`

## Ordered Todo list
1) DONE - create visualization of kids
2) DONE - collapsing kid tables
3) OPTIONAL - add standardjs
4) DONE - make jest and enzyme running
5) add posibility to delete row
6) create store

### Struggles notices
- Understanding the data structure and what exactly should I make took me few days. First to data models went out of the window because the would not match the dinamic possibilies of given data.
- Using MST will be problematic because of dynamic data. Should still be possible, but will be challenging as I have never used it on dynamic data before.
- Typescript makes development slower but the code is more reliable. Transfer from flow is smoother than I have expected.
- I was struggling with Jest and Enzyme snapshot testing. It was caused by create-react-app missinitialization when I was creating the repository.
